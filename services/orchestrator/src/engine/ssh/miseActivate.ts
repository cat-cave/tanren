// Mise activation helper (environment-management.md §3 Layer 2): make the project's
// `mise`-provisioned toolchain ACTIVE for the project's OWN command execution, so a
// bare `node`/`pnpm`/etc in the project's bootstrap/gate command resolves to the
// version the project DECLARED in its `mise.toml` (provisioned at workspace-prep via
// `mise install`), rather than the runner's harness node.
//
// THE TWO-PATH SEPARATION (the crux of P0b/c):
//   - PROJECT-COMMAND path — the project's bootstrap + gate tiers (and the build/
//     deploy commands that run through the gate). These run the project's DECLARED
//     shell, which may call a bare `pnpm`/`node`/`python`. They MUST be mise-activated
//     so those resolve to the project's declared toolchain. `withMiseActivation`
//     prefixes them with `eval "$(mise activate bash --shims)"` (the documented
//     non-interactive / CI activation — see `miseActivationPrelude` for WHY hook-mode
//     is wrong here), guarded on a `mise.toml` being present in the cwd (so a project
//     that declared no toolchain is unaffected — the activation is a no-op).
//   - HARNESS / answerer path — `codex` (writer + Checker/Auditor). It runs on the
//     runner's OWN isolated node (P0a installs the harness node on the system PATH and
//     does NOT globally activate mise). This module is NEVER applied there: the codex
//     exec path (engine/providers/codex.ts) builds its command directly and stays on
//     the harness node, untouched by the project's toolchain.
//
// SECURITY: like the app-env prelude, the activation is prepended ONLY to the EXECUTED
// command string handed to the SSH substrate — never to a logged/emitted command (gate
// `step.run`, the bootstrap error's `command`), so the original command still flows
// into every event. The prelude contains no secret material.

import { quoteSshShellArg } from "./command.js";

// The conventional path of the project's `mise.toml` (mirrors
// SKELETON_MISE_CONFIG_PATH; kept local so this ssh helper has no scaffold dep). The
// guard tests for THIS file in the command's cwd before activating.
const MISE_CONFIG_REL_PATH = "mise.toml";

// The mise activation prelude. It uses the `--shims` mode of `mise activate`, which
// emits a plain, POSIX `export PATH="…/shims:$PATH"` that IMMEDIATELY puts the project's
// mise shims on PATH for the rest of the `bash -c`/`sh -c` command (the shims dispatch
// to the per-dir active version resolved from `mise.toml`); we `eval` it so a bare
// `node`/`pnpm` resolves to the declared version.
//
// WHY NOT plain `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` (the hook mode): that emits an
// INTERACTIVE shell hook (a `mise()` shim function + a `_mise_hook` precmd/chpwd hook)
// whose PATH update fires only on an interactive prompt or a `cd` — NOT immediately for
// the non-interactive `bash -c "<prelude>; <command>"` we run over SSH, so a bare
// `pnpm` would not be found (the observed failure: `mise install` provisions
// node+pnpm fine, then `pnpm install` dies with `sh: pnpm: not found`, exit 127). The
// hook-mode output is also full of bash-only syntax (`__MISE_FLAGS=()` arrays,
// `declare -f`, `[[ … ]]`), so under a non-bash project shell (e.g. a `just` recipe run
// via `sh`/dash, the actual live failure shell) it `eval`s to a syntax error and never
// touches PATH at all. The `--shims` export is POSIX-clean and is inherited by child
// shells, so the toolchain survives into `just`/`sh -c` sub-invocations too.
//
// GUARDED: it only activates when a `mise.toml` exists in the cwd, so a project that
// declared NO toolchain (no mise.toml materialized) runs exactly as before (the
// activation is skipped, a pure no-op). `MISE_YES=1` keeps any mise sub-action
// non-interactive. The whole prelude is one `if … fi; ` statement chained before the
// real command with `;` (NOT `&&`): a project with no mise.toml must still run its
// command — the guard is a skip, not a gate.
